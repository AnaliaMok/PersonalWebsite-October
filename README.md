This repository is where I will temporarily house and develop my revamped personal website. I currently have a static website hosted [here](https://analiamok.github.io). I did develop that website using php - for ease of maintenance. That site was of course translated to plain html since github pages only supports static sites. However, I quite quickly found limitations to this approach when it comes to content maintenance. The solution: utilize a content management system.

At the moment, I plan to experiment with [October CMS](https://octobercms.com)

## Why not Wordpress?
Well, currently I live and breathe Wordpress development for my 9-5. Wordpress is extensible and has all the features that I would want for a personal website. Even though I don't plan to add a blog section, having wordpress as a backend would allow me to easily implement one. Wordpress has been around for over a decade now and has a large hub for plugins and support. However, for my purposes, October CMS seems more appropriate.

## Why October CMS?
October is simpler, cleaner, and it's core functionality possesses features that would normally be a plugin or an extended feature in Wordpress.
Extensibility is also much more well structured. There technically is no OOP in WP. You can enforce one yourself, but it's not required. With October, you are given a PluginBase Class right out the gate. I am a huge proponent for structured, well-defined code and having a pre-defined structure is not only amazing, but will also save me development headaches and time.

## Goals
1. Learn as much about October as possible
2. Define my preferences between October CMS and Wordpress
3. Create a much more maintainable website that I can update whenever I want - without touching much code or markup
4. Complete all of this in a 2 week sprint.

<p>A short Asian girl who started programming towards the end of high school and later went on to attend Rochester Institute of Technology as a Computer Science major. Eventually went on to minor in Mobile 
Development and found my love for the web development sphere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm just someone who wants to know it all. From Laravel to React Native, from WebAssembly to Go, I want to learn them all - or at least touch them to some capacity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm a work horse. If something needs to be done, I will absolutely make sure to get the job done: even if it takes a few sleepless nights and an ungodly amount of coffee. Besides, my personality doesn't really fit with a 9 to 5 restriction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    I'm a geek. Plain and simple. I watch coding tutorials and tech talks for fun; I did kind of hint that with the whole "learning" part <em>*hint hint nudge nudge*</em>. Beyond programming, I am an overall tech geek as 
    well as a coffee and rock climbing nerd.
